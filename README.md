# Learn Selenium

## Setting up local development

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/bigbinary/learn-selenium-book.git
$ cd website
$ npm install

 # this will start a server on port 3000 by default
$ npm start 
```

## Building Static HTML pages

To create a static build of the book, run the following script from the `website` directory.

```bash
$ cd website
$ npm run build
```

We will find the generated e-book in `website/build` directory. The `docs` directory can be deleted anytime as it gets generated whenever we build the project.

## Adding a chapter

1. Add the chapter in `book` directory.
2. Add the entry of the chapter in `book/ToC.json`

## Code-block customization

1. To show `line-numbers` in code-block, we can add them as

    ```markdown
    ```js line-numbers
    import FormComponent from '../components/form.component';
    import { emailInputSelector } from "../selectors/sign_up_selectors";
    ...
    ...
    ```

2. To highlight in a code-block, we can add line number within `{}`. eg., `{2}` or `{1-4,3}`

    ```markdown
    ```js{2}
    import FormComponent from '../components/form.component';
    import { emailInputSelector } from "../selectors/sign_up_selectors";
    ...
    ...
    ```
